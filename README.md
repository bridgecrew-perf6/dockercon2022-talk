# DockerCon 2022 Talk

This repo contains all the source, configurations, deployment tweaks that were
presented as a talk to [DockerCon 2022](https://mobile.twitter.com/dockercon).

To run the entire stack all in one place, just head to the `entire-platform`
directory and run `docker-compose up -d`.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Don't forget to
[update](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) your docker-compose binary
to v2.
